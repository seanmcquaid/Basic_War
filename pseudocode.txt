Things Needed:
-Increment DOWN for each card dealt - create text that keeps track of number of cards = each player gets a deck of 26 
-deal a card to each user - whichever card is higher wins points for each card 
-if tie occurs = take away 5 cards for each user from the deck and deal each user a card. Whoever wins gets points for EACH CARD dealt
have point counters for each users score
-if user score = 52 , game is over
